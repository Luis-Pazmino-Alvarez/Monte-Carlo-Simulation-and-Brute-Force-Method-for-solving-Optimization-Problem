# Monte Carlo Simulation vs Brute Force Method for solving Optimization Problem
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies Monte Carlo simulation and Brute Force Method to analyze and solve a real-world production optimization problem faced by a furniture manufacturing company. The scenario models uncertainty in production capacity and evaluates various production plans using a brute-force approach combined with simulation to identify the plan that maximizes expected profit.

ðŸª‘ Problem Description
The problem is based on the operations of Veerman Furniture Company, which produces three types of office furniture: chairs, desks, and tables. Each item consumes resources from several departments (fabrication, assembly, shipping), and labor constraints and market demands introduce uncertainty. The goal is to determine the optimal production mix that maximizes total quarterly profit, accounting for uncertain events.

ðŸ§  Methodology
Brute-Force Method: All feasible combinations of production plans are evaluated against the company's constraints.

Monte Carlo Simulation: For each feasible plan, simulation is used to model uncertainty in labor requirements and delivery conditions.

Evaluation Metrics: The simulation captures variations in profit under uncertainty, and the best-performing strategy is selected.

ðŸ“ˆ Key Features
